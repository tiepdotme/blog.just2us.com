I <a href="http://blog.just2us.com/2009/05/sg-4d/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.just2us.com/2009/05/sg-4d/', 'launched');" target="_blank">launched</a> SG 4D app in Mar 2009.

After 4 years, I am now transferring ownership to someone else. Starting withÂ <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/sg-4d/id294815815?mt=8&at=11luru" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/sg-4d/id294815815?mt=8&at=11luru', 'version 3.0');" target="_blank">version 3.0</a>, it is developed by another company.

The good news is:

  * The app no longer has ads!
  * And you don&#8217;t have to pay to unlock the PRO features!

Reminiscing.. I developed SG 4D because of my dad. He always switches my TV to teletext at 7pm. I created the app for him, and many others.

Many people thought I like to buy 4D or Toto. But no, I discourage the game, and has never spent more than $10 in my entire life! I always discourage my dad on what a waste of money on the game.

I am glad that I took this journey, and earned back what he lost :)

&#8220;Don&#8217;t have to see. You never win one lah&#8221;, is what I always said to him.
