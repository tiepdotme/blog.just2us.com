[Encopresis](https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/encopresis) is the soiling of underwear with stool by children who are big enough to be toilet trained (eg. more than 4 years old).

It affects around **1% of children in US**.

And the major cause is prolong constipation.

Here's what happened when children, _or anyone_, who forget to clear their bowels:

- more stool is collected in the lower intestine/colon
- colon stretches more and more, and loses the urge to pass bowel
- looser stool higher up leaks down, and small amount leaks out
- as time goes on, child is less aware, and unknowingly pass the entire bowel

So for parents, it is important to prevent constipation. While [Baby Log](https://just2us.com/babylog) is useful for the initiate diaper stage, it is still useful to track _post-diaper_ stage.

Or we have another app -- [Poo Keeper](https://just2us.com/pookeeper) -- that tracks specifically for poops, including taking photos of it (useful for analysis by doctors), and helpful reminders.
