In the last few months, during this #StayAtHome period, we have developed a new app.

[Schooling Papa](https://just2us.com/schoolingpapa/) is to help kids learn new language effectively. It's using good old flashcards that works.

For parents, it will be a good helper. You no longer need to flash card after card, pronouncing words after words. The app does it for you ðŸ˜„

We are parents. Yep, once again, we build this for ourselves.

[Pre-order](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1511933484?at=11luru) now at a special price of US$1.99! The app will officially release in early July.
