Our latest app is a personal finance app, helping you track the most important number in regards to your wealth -- **networth**.

(We know _net worth_ is the _correct_ English spelling, but we prefer to use it as one non-breaking word.)

## What is networth?

> NETWORTH = ASSETS - LIABILITIES

Sum up all your assets. Sum up all your liabilities. The difference is your networth.

**It is how much money you truly have.**

A simple formula, yet beautiful.

_Do you know companies track their "networth" all the time?_ In their quarterly earnings report, under the balance sheet, the networth of a company = equity, using the exact same formula.

## How people track their personal finances?

There are many personal finance apps. The most popular kinds are [expense trackers](https://www.shopback.sg/blog/best-expense-tracker-app), such as Toshl, Wally, and Money Lover.

However, we find such apps to be very difficult to use because **entering every expenses is tedious**.

I could easily have 10 transactions in a day.

Okay, some apps have the capability to sync. That's because some banks provide open API for reading their data. And those without direct open API, some apps use web scrapping means to read your bank data, given your log in credentials.

There is lots of **security concerns** around all these sync.

## Using a Spreadsheet

I don't use an expense tracker. I use a Google Spreadsheet to track all my accounts and balances, some times noting big expenses.

This is similar to [DoughRoller](https://www.doughroller.net/personal-finance/3-tools-to-track-your-net-worth/), though he use a combination of expense trackers + Spreadsheet. He always have a spreadsheet which he updates his assets & liabilities, once every month.

Why does one still need a spreadsheet?

1. Flexibility - Easily evolve as needed eg. joint account, co-investments, disregard certain accounts
2. Big Picture - Shows all the accounts and money in 1 place

I have a real life example.

This is my personal finance (a sample). I created my spreadsheet in 2013, and evolved it constantly. This is what it really looks like, but I changed some figures & accounts, because that is my privacy :D


## And why mac app?

It has been a very different development as mac is much different from iOS counterpart. While mac is older, the OS actually
