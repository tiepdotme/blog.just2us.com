_[Originally posted on Medium:](https://blog.jade2us.com/baby-log-another-app-for-new-parents-984696d02152#.5u5t1emw5)_

Shortly after launching [Jade](http://jade2us.com/), I started on a new app.

While Jade is a great journal app to pen down memorable moments with your child, logging mundane stuff — feedings, diaper change, weight, etc— is best logged somewhere else.

I use a note book and physically record these mundane stuff.

On a typical day, I could record up to 8 feedings and 8 diaper change! That’s a lot of times I have to flip open the book, and write down the time and details.

## Benefits of logging

I am not a believer of logging too much. I didn’t want to log in a book at first..

But after a few loud shrieks that left me totally clueless on _WHY ARE YOU CRYING_, I decided it is best that we (all caregivers) know:

- when and how much was the baby last fed?
- when was the last diaper change?
- when and how long was the sleep?
- is there constipation?
- is baby gaining weight normally?

Turned out keeping a log book answer these questions.

And so I turned the log book into an app (:

## Download Baby Log

There are many similar apps that tracks the same thing. One of the most popular is [Baby Connect](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id326574411?mt=8) (formally Activity Logger), which cost US$4.99, but I find it complex to use.

Perhaps they are too comprehensive, had too many different data to show/add, therefore a glance at their Dashboard makes me dizzy..

And so I designed Baby Log to be elegant and fast to use.

I also designed the Photo album to display Kate’s photos with her age, so we can see her growing beautifully (:

Baby Log is a paid app, at US$1.99. Find out more from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1065722243?at=11luru).

You can also use one of the [2O promo codes](http://codehookup.com/ffc8d7fe) to download for FREE, if you are lucky.
