I was watching this awesome [Moscow concert by Ed Sheeran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VUoCFc_2Uo), on Youtube.

If you watch the 2 hours long concert, you will notice that there are literally hundreds of phones in the air, all the time.

They are recording a great moment of their life. I do that too, and I understand how nice it is to playback those recorded video, bringing you back that feeling during the concert.

But we could record _better_.

That's why we developed [Concert Camera](https://just2us.com/concertcamera/) app.

I hope more people could adopt our app!
