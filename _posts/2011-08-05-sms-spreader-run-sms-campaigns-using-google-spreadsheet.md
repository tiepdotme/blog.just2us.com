There are many online websites that helps SMS marketers send thousands of SMS. You have to upload an excel file containing the mobile numbers, then configure to run the campaign.

It was never easy finding and choosing a good web service that does that well.

However, running an SMS campaign actually do not need any web services. All you need is a Google Spreadsheet with all the mobile numbers and messages that you want to send.

I am introducing to you **<a href="http://bit.ly/qFQRRQ" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://bit.ly/qFQRRQ', 'Google Spreader');">Google Spreader</a>** – A Google Spreadsheet app that helps you send thousands of SMS.

<a href="http://bit.ly/qFQRRQ" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://bit.ly/qFQRRQ', '');"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="SMS blasting useing spreadsheet" border="0" alt="SMS blasting useing spreadsheet" src="http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/SMS-blasting-useing-spreadsheet.jpg" width="644" height="332" /></a>

The benefits are:

  * Use what you are familiar with in SMS Marketing – spreadsheet
  * Send thousands, or millions, of SMS directly from the spreadsheet
