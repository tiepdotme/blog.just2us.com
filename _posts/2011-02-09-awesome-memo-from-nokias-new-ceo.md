<p align="justify">
  Stephen Elop, Nokia’s new CEO, has sent out an <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/08/nokia-ceo-stephen-elop-rallies-troops-in-brutally-honest-burnin/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/08/nokia-ceo-stephen-elop-rallies-troops-in-brutally-honest-burnin/', 'awesome internal memo');">awesome internal memo</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Yes, I said <strong>Awesome</strong>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  This is because it is not common for a CEO to send out a memo<em> highlighting how terrible</em> they have done. In the memo, Stephen confessed they are have lagged behind Apple and Android by many years, and he honestly admitted that there are problems within the company – attitude, accountability and leadership.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  He is a brave soul to send out such a memo. How many CEOs have the courage to click the send button?
</p>

<p align="justify">
  And more amazingly, adding to the awesome score, his letter exhibited a spirit to bounce back. He portrayed that they are now on a “burning platform”, and they will take a bold step to jump into the “icy water”. They will survive, and live to tell a story.
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Somehow, I believe they will survive. Perhaps this memo will be a turning point for Nokia.
</p>
