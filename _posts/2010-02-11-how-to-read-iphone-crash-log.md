Many times, application crashes, and a developer will have no idea what is the cause (_if he knows, it would not have happened_).

I am not providing the how-to here, instead I am referring to <a href="http://www.anoshkin.net/blog/2008/09/09/iphone-crash-logs/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.anoshkin.net/blog/2008/09/09/iphone-crash-logs/', 'anoshkin’s blog post');">anoshkin’s blog post</a>.

One valuable lesson I learnt: **Always keep the dSYM for each version released**

I did not know that I should keep the dSYM, and when I need it, I don’t have it.. Bad.
