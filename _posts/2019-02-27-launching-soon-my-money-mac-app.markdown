We will be launching our first ever mac app in a few days!

[![Pre-order on mac App Store](/img/mymoney-preorder-mac-app-store.jpg)](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1444268988)

As usual, we made the app because we want to use such a personal finance app.

Personally, it is a replacement to my _Google Sheet_ that keeps track of my personal finance.

My Money has been in the work for a number of months. Well, at last, I can finally retire my Google Sheet and do even more with the app.
