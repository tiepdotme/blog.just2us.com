There is a method to easily create multiple, or thousands, of email accounts! All it requires is 1 real <a href="http://gmail.com" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://gmail.com', 'gmail');">gmail</a> account.

Let’s say you have 1 gmail account &#8211; <ladygaga@gmail.com>

Then you _already_ have multiple gmail accounts!&#160; <ladygaga+1@gmail.com>, <ladygaga+2@gmail.com>, etc..

This is because gmail has this cool trick where it can let you pre-label your emails. It works by giving out a version of your email that comes with the label. Eg. if you want to label all emails from your colleagues with “work”, then you would give them <ladygaga+work@gmail.com>. 

You might be wondering: why would I need multiple email accounts?

It depends. For me, having multiple email accounts allow me to register certain services multiple times. For example, if a trial account expires in 1 month, I could infinitely register for trial accounts using different email accounts (:

I have also used the trick when <a href="http://just2us.com/2010/02/how-to-register-us-itunes-account/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://just2us.com/2010/02/how-to-register-us-itunes-account/', 'registering for a US iTunes Account');">registering for a US iTunes Account</a> (in addition to my SG iTunes Account).
