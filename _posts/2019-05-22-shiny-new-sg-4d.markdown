SG 4D+ is a new app, developed from the ground up, with a beautiful UI that will be fitting _for even iOS 13_. You can [pre-order now](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1460105403?at=11luru), and it will be ready by May 28!

SG 4D was first launched for the first iPhone [way back in 2009](/2009/05/sg-4d/). It has gone through several versions in the last 10 years, and this time it will be version 4.

This time, we are making it different.

This time, we are launching a new separate app.

The requirement will be iOS 10, and will be very different inside.

Oh yes, we have **LIVE BROADCAST** this time.

Watch as each number is drawn, and read out to you.

You will still see the familiar tab bar, and still having access to all the results all the way back till 1986.

We keep what is still good, but some things have to go.

The user interface is updated for the modern iPhone X's, and also supporting the iPad Pro.

We have added more friendly places where you can easily check the 4D results, such as using the widget in the today screen.
