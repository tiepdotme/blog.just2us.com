If you belong to a **developed country**, this book provokes you to “wake up!” and realize how fast the developing country is catching up.

If you belong to a **developing country**, this books shows you the advantage that you have over the developed country, and urge you to outrun them.

In the last pages of the book, there is a manifesto from the perspective of a developing world. Must watch!

Lifting one of the memorable paragraph in the book:

> “I never plan”  
   
> &#8211; Jack Ma, Founder of alibaba.com
> 
> If 2 people compete in a race and one is planning to get out of bed and put his shoe on, while the other is already running, then the person will come first.
> 
> I just mean that the orienteer who is forever looking at the map will not win.
> 
> The winner is the one who runs fastest in the right direction while looking at the map once in a while to make sure he is running in the right way.
