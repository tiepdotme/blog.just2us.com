Following the <a href="http://blog.just2us.com/2010/10/idon8-released/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.just2us.com/2010/10/idon8-released/', 'release of iDon8');">release of iDon8</a>, <a href="http://www.igiveblood.com" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.igiveblood.com', 'TBA');">TBA</a> is reaching out to High School by giving away an iPad, and introducing them the convenience of the blood donation app!

<div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: none; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:743e72aa-e095-41e3-80de-d91e5c06da21" class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent">

Quoted from TBA press release:

> The iDon8 App offers eligible donors the opportunity to keep a record of their previous donations, alert them of their next available date to donate, and conveniently provides locations of blood drives via Google Maps. iDon8 also provides donors with area notifications when the community blood supply becomes low or critical. Convenience is the best resource in reaching donors, and the blood bank’s App offers donors the ability to become a hero &#8211; by saving lives from the palm of a donor’s hand.
> 
> “We are always looking for creative ways to encourage our younger community members especially high school students, to become donors, and we thought this might be a great way to provide them with an incentive to start donating,” said Valerie Collins, Chief Operating Officer of The Blood Alliance. “With our iPad promotion and our smart phone App, we feel we are speaking their language.”
