SG Radio is (finally) released! It took a long 2 months before it is finally approved by Apple.

There were some hiccups due to our first design that looked too much like Apple’s iPod, and so we had to redesign, and redesign.. More details on how SG Radio was rejected by Apple in a later post.

Now, let’s look at what the app does!

<a href="http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen11.png" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen11.png', '');"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-530" src="http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen11.png" alt="Screen1.png" width="320" height="480" srcset="http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen11-200x300.png 200w, http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen11.png 512w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a>

Simply put, SG Radio plays radio from SG!

It is like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/meradio/id369117106?mt=8" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/meradio/id369117106?mt=8', 'MeRadio');">MeRadio</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/91-3fm/id393869177?mt=8" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/91-3fm/id393869177?mt=8', 'Radio 91.3');">Radio 91.3</a> and  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/radio-100-3/id393871150?mt=8" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/radio-100-3/id393871150?mt=8', 'Radio 100.3');">Radio 100.3</a> combined, but with slicker interface, yet packed with better features! We highlight 3 features below:

&nbsp;

## 15 Radio Stations

This is the only iPhone app that plays ALL 15 Singapore radio stations, from BOTH Media Corp’s and SPH’s!

## Rewind and Forward

<a href="http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen4_thumb1.png" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen4_thumb1.png', '');"><img class="alignnone" style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Screen4" src="http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen4_thumb1.png" alt="Screen4" width="246" height="366" align="left" border="0" /></a>This is a feature that only we support!

Missed something that your deejay said? Don’t worry! With SG Radio, you can rewind, and listen again and again! (Note: Rewind is a locked feature, while pause and forward is free)

You can also pause a radio station while you pick up a call, or attending to some other business, and SG Radio will buffer whatever you are missing! When you un-pause, you will be able to listen from the point you paused, missing not a single thing!

We love this and hope you like it!

## Currently Playing Songs

<a href="http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen31.png" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen31.png', '');"><img class="alignnone" style="background-image: none; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="Screen3" src="http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen3_thumb1.png" alt="Screen3" width="246" height="366" align="left" border="0" /></a>Showing the currently playing song from a radio station is nothing fantastic.

But we have done it better. We show you ALL songs that all 15 radio stations are currently playing in 1 place! Now you can switch over to a station easily when you see your favorite song playing.

We love this too and hope you like it!
