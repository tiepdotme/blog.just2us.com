I tried 3 software on my Mac for conducting usability testing for a website.

The first software is using Quick Time, which comes free with every Mac OS X. Quick Time has screen recording feature &#8211; which is minimally good enough for capturing a usability session. We all know Quick Time is not a dedicated software for usability testing. But it&#8217;s free to get started :)

I went on to try out 2 other softwares.

## 1. Camtasia

<a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia-mac-features.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia-mac-features.html', 'Camtasia');" target="_blank">Camtasia</a> has been around for like 10 years. It is the most well known software for screen recording on Windows and also on Mac.

I tried it out (free for 30 days), and I like it. It records the screen and iSight simultaneously.

It cost $99 USD.

I would probably stick with Camtasia if not for Silverback.

## 2. Silverback

<a href="http://silverbackapp.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://silverbackapp.com/', 'Silverback');" target="_blank">Silverback</a> is created by Clearleft, a user experience design consultancy company. They created this software for none other than themselves!

It works like Camtasia, with a focus for creating usability &#8220;projects&#8221; and &#8220;sessions&#8221;.

DURING a usability session, you can easily add tasks and highlights using Apple Remote. That&#8217;s very cool!

And it&#8217;s $69 USD.

Silverback is my choice!
