Good news from Apple, my SG Motor Racing iPhone app is released today!

Usually my apps usually get approved like inÂ <a href="http://just2us.com/2010/09/my-torchlight-app-2-days-to-do-22-days-to-approve/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://just2us.com/2010/09/my-torchlight-app-2-days-to-do-22-days-to-approve/', '22 days');">22 days</a>, but this time, I requested Apple for an expedited review, and they grant me.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/SG-Racing-approve-in-12-days.png" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/SG-Racing-approve-in-12-days.png', '');"><img class="size-medium wp-image-438  aligncenter" title="SG Racing approve in 12 days" src="http://just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/SG-Racing-approve-in-12-days-300x135.png" alt="" width="300" height="135" /></a>
</p>

But I&#8217;m happy, since it is in time for <a href="http://www.singaporegp.sg/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.singaporegp.sg/', 'Singapore Grand Prix 2010');">Singapore Grand Prix 2010</a>. It has been my wishlist app for 3 years since GP has been held in Singapore. Glad that I have time to develop on this very 3rd year :)
