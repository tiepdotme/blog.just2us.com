I had this idea of developing blood donation app when I know about the <a href="http://www.nuffnang.com.sg/blog/2008/11/11/singapores-first-blogger-blood-drive-by-nuffnang/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nuffnang.com.sg/blog/2008/11/11/singapores-first-blogger-blood-drive-by-nuffnang/', 'Nuffnang blood donation drive');">Nuffnang blood donation drive</a>. I did not participate in the bloggers blood donation, but I did feel how heart warming it is when a community set out to do something good. 

I hope iPhone community can achieve a similar feat. 

Lastly, you might not like certain ways the app works. But there is only one objective for the app: 

Give blood and give life (: 

&#160;

**More about the App:**

SG Blood provides the calendar for Bloodmobile events, giving donors the convenient of planning where and when they want to contribute. The details for the 2 permanent blood donation centres &#8211; HSA and NUH &#8211; are also available within the app. A simple FAQ also helps to address the questions that new donors would like to know. 

Features include: 

  * Calendar for Bloodmobile events 
  * Show on Google map the location of a Bloodmobile event 
  * Record the date of the last donation 
  * Display info, address, map and phone numbers of the 2 blood donation centres (HSA and NUH) 
  * FAQ for new donors
