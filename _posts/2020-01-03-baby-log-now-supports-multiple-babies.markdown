In the [new version](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1065722243?at=11luru) of Baby Log (v1.9), we have added support for multiple babies.

Yes, we know.

Parents don't stop at one.

_At least I didn't stop. My baby -- Jade -- will be arriving soon._

Note: This is a **Pro feature**, for US$2.99 to go Pro.
