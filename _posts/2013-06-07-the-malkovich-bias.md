I have learnt of a new phenomena.

**The Malkovich Bias** &#8211; is defined as **the tendency to believe that everyone uses the web the same way as you do**.

How many times have you heard friends/colleagues saying these:

_&#8220;No one will click on advertisement banners.&#8221;_

_“That needs to go above the fold because no one scrolls.”_

_&#8220;Everyone skims. They don&#8217;t read.&#8221;_

_&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t be able to know this link is clickable.&#8221;_

_&#8220;That feels weird.&#8221;_

_&#8220;That will be confusing for our users.&#8221;_

When one said something based on their web experience, that is known as the Malkovich Bias effect.

It&#8217;s dangerous, because many times they could be very wrong.

That&#8217;s why we must conduct <a href="http://blog.just2us.com/tag/usability/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.just2us.com/tag/usability/', 'usability testing');" target="_blank">usability testing</a>.

PS: 1% of people click on ads. Food for thoughts.
