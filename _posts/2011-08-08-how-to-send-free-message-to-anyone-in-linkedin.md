No doubt <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.linkedin.com/', 'LinkedIn');">LinkedIn</a> is the biggest social network for working professionals. 

LinkedIn is very useful for finding people with job opportunities, or connecting for business partnership. However, it doesn&#8217;t come cheap to use LinkedIn. To be able to send someone a message, it requires a <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=welcome_premium" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=welcome_premium', 'premium account');">premium account</a>, which cost at least $30 per month (just to send 3 messages).

Follow this to send FREE messages:

  * Browse someone profile
  * Scroll to the section Additional Information > Groups and Associations
  * Join one of his group (it might take time for admin to approve)
  * Go to the Group > Members, and search his name
  * Use the "Send message"

<a href="http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/linkedin-free-send-message.jpg" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/linkedin-free-send-message.jpg', '');"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="linkedin-free-send-message" border="0" alt="linkedin-free-send-message" src="http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/linkedin-free-send-message_thumb.jpg" width="644" height="192" /></a>

In the unfortunate event that the person did not join any group, this trick would not work. If that happens, look for clues in his profile such as twitter or website.
