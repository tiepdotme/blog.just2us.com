After attending an exhibition, I ended up with 50 business cards! Here comes a problem.

All (or most) of them are good contacts that I would like to save to a spreadsheet. And so I searched for an app/service that can help me. I ended up with <a href="http://www.shoeboxed.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.shoeboxed.com/', 'shoeboxed');" target="_blank">shoeboxed</a>, with is probably good, but cost $0.20 a card. Not satisfied, I looked around for a free solution.. My conclusion is that it is either paid, or not good.

However, I come up with my own quick & free solution, using a couple of free technologies :)

## Steps to digitize all your business cards

1) **Use <a href="http://cardmunch.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://cardmunch.com/', 'CardMunch');">CardMunch</a> to scan all the namecards** with an iPhone. Also go to iPhone Settings > CardMunch > and enable contacts auto save. As each namecard is scanned and processed (takes a couple of minutes), they will be automatically saved to the iPhone.

2) **Enable iCloud** for syncing the iPhone contacts. This is to auto sync the contacts between iPhone and a Mac.

3) **Open Mac Address Book** and search for &#8220;Scanned on&#8230;&#8221;. This will filter the contacts that were added by CardMunch! Select these contacts and export in vcf.

4) **Convert the vcf to csv** using <a href="http://labs.brotherli.ch/vcfconvert/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://labs.brotherli.ch/vcfconvert/', 'http://labs.brotherli.ch/vcfconvert/');">http://labs.brotherli.ch/vcfconvert/</a>.

5) **Open the csv** file with Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheet!

You may also clean up your iPhone contacts by deleting away those contacts from Mac Address Book :)

This is the power of CardMunch and iCloud!
