Over the past few weeks, I was trying out [Facebook newly opened chat platform](http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/12/agents-on-messenger/), and build a [SG 4D](/stories/#SG%204D) bot.

Our bot, named _Didi_, is at an infant stage, and does not possess AI you see in Terminator.

The plan was to improve it's intelligence by using [wit.ai](http://wit.ai/) in the next version.

However, this v1 bot is deemed not good enough for Facebook reviewers.

Apparently _Didi_ could not establish a meaningful conversation with the bot reviewer.

Without a correct reply to the "hi" and "hello", the bot app is rejected.


## Gatekeeper

I agree that not knowing how to respond to "hi" is not good enough. I will fix that.

The question is:

_How much to fix and improve?_

_What are the bot reviewer guidelines?_

I have seen how terrible and frightening Apple app reviewers are. It is killing us developers.

I am afraid Facebook bot reviewers will be the same.
