<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Shortly after launching <a href="http://jade2us.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://jade2us.com/', 'Jade');">Jade</a>, I started on a new app.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">While Jade is a great journal app to pen down memorable moments with your child, logging mundane stuff — feedings, diaper change, weight, etc— is best logged somewhere else.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I use a note book and physically record these mundane stuff.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">On a typical day, I could record up to 8 feedings and 8 diaper change! That’s a lot of times I have to flip open the book, and write down the time and details.</span>
</p>

## <span class="s1">Benefits of logging</span> {.p4}

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I am not a believer of logging too much. I didn’t want to log in a book at first..</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">But after a few loud shrieks that left me totally clueless on <i>WHY ARE YOU CRYING</i>, I decided it is best that we (all caregivers) know:</span>
</p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">
    <span class="s1">when and how much was the baby last fed?</span>
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    <span class="s1">when was the last diaper change?</span>
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    <span class="s1">when and how long was the sleep?</span>
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    <span class="s1">is there constipation?</span>
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    <span class="s1">is baby gaining weight normally?</span>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Turned out keeping a log book answer these questions.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And so I turned the log book into an app (:</span>

## <span class="s1">Download Baby Log</span> {.p4}

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">There are many similar apps that tracks the same thing. One of the most popular is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/baby-connect-activity-logger/id326574411?mt=8" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/baby-connect-activity-logger/id326574411?mt=8', 'Baby Connect');">Baby Connect</a> (formally Activity Logger), which cost US$4.99, but I find it complex to use.</span>

    <strong>Baby Connect&#8217;s Dashboard</strong>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">Perhaps they are too comprehensive, had too many different data to show/add, therefore a glance at their Dashboard makes me dizzy..</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">And so I designed Baby Log to be elegant and fast to use.</span>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">I also designed the Photo album to display Kate’s photos with her age, so we can see her growing beautifully (:</span>
