Neil Gaiman, one of the most creative writer who writes stuff out of nowhere, <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/p/Cool_Stuff/Essays/Essays_By_Neil/Where_do_you_get_your_ideas%3F" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.neilgaiman.com/p/Cool_Stuff/Essays/Essays_By_Neil/Where_do_you_get_your_ideas%3F', 'explains how he gets his ideas');">explains how he gets his ideas</a>..

In the post, he said everyone has some good ideas. Some people will approach him with the idea and ask him to write for them, and split the money 50-50.. 

> I&#8217;m reasonably gracious with these people. I tell them, truly, that I have far too many ideas for things as it is, and far too little time. And I wish them the best of luck.

Developers are akin to authors.

I too, keep a long list of ideas.
