I can give you an invite to Quora. <del datetime="2012-02-10T05:16:33+00:00">Just leave a message with your email in the comments.</del> Go <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFQ3bWhJa045Z0RQa2I1SzhfbFdFaHc6MQ" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFQ3bWhJa045Z0RQa2I1SzhfbFdFaHc6MQ', 'here');" target="_blank">here</a>, or simply enter you email below:



I used to think that Quora invite is hard to get, because I have never been invited by anyone. I was wrong. A Quora account can invite as many friends. So I think I never got an invite is just because it is not popular enough. Ah, I got mine because I asked, and I was easily given.

In my opinion, I would say Quora is a great question-and-answer web service. I find it useful for asking good questions. If you have an account, pleaseÂ <a href="http://www.quora.com/Junda-Ong" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.quora.com/Junda-Ong', 'follow me');">follow me</a> :)
