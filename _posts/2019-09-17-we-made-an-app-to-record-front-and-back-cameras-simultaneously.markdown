Every phone now has at least 2 cameras - the main camera and the selfie camera (_while the latest iPhone 11 has **4 cameras**_)!

But have you ever wonder if you can use MULTIPLE cameras at the same time?

Have you ever wish to shoot both the scenery, and also your selfie/wefie?

We made [Dualgram](https://dualgram.com) for iPhone, and we believe it will be useful when the "action" is not just on one side of the phone.

You can now capture precious moments _entirely_.

If you are a vlogger, you no longer need to switch between what you are seeing and yourself.

I have personally use Dualgram during my holiday to Okinawa, and it produces a different kind of videography üòé

We will be launching shortly, once Apple approves the app ü§ûüèª

So likely in 3-5 days, you can download the [FREE Dualgram app](https://dualgram.com) on your iPhone.

_NOTE: Dualgram uses advanced hardware and software, therefore we can only support iPhone XR and above, including XS, and the latest iPhone 11._
