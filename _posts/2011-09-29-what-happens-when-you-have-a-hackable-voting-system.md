<img style="margin: 0px 15px 10px 0px; display: inline; float: left" align="left" src="http://asiatop50apps.com/wp-content/themes/singtel/images/singtel-asias-top-50-apps-logo.png" width="145" height="145" />Unfortunately, this happened to <a href="http://asiatop50apps.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://asiatop50apps.com/', 'Asia&#8217;s Top 50 Apps');">Asia&#8217;s Top 50 Apps</a> nomination, presented by <a href="http://six.sg/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://six.sg/', 'Singtel Innovation Exchange');">Singtel Innovation Exchange</a>, and <a href="http://e27.sg" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://e27.sg', 'e27');">e27</a> as the organizer.

Interestingly, e27 community manager posted a <a href="http://e27.sg/2011/09/29/hi-there-can-we-please-focus-on-building-the-community/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://e27.sg/2011/09/29/hi-there-can-we-please-focus-on-building-the-community/', 'blunt story');">blunt story</a> about their flawed voting system.

I like how the story revealed things from an organizer perspective. However, he is admitting to his mistake, and yet not doing anything about it. Quoted:

> <cite>Go ahead, do it. We probably won’t find out.&#160; Keep it up, kudos to you. You’ll probably end up on the top of the list and be awarded the People’s Choice Award. </cite>

Since the voting system is not going to be fixed, there are only 2 possibilities:

  1. No one cheated (because developers have integrity!) 
  2. Someone cheated 

Since (2) is always a possibility, whoever turn out as the winner, will also turn out to be a cheater/loser.. 

I thought, since that is the case, I might as well submit my <a href="http://blog.just2us.com/2010/04/sg-blood-v2/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.just2us.com/2010/04/sg-blood-v2/', 'SG Blood');">SG Blood</a> and **curl it to be the winner**.

_No one going to dispute a non-profitable app winning for a good cause, right?_
