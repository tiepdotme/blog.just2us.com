I was out jogging the other day.

At the end of my run, I wanted to buy a drink, but I soon realized that I have forgotten to bring along cash with me! I have my iPhone with me, but can it pay for my drinks?

I started to think of solutions..

Thinking: If everyone is a mobile ATM, and I could use my phone to transfer money electronically to these mobile ATM, it will be great! As long as they could “dispense” the money, I would not mind paying a commission fee for the service.

Not bad an idea.. Hence I am submitting it for <a href="https://www.x.com/community/ppx/devchallenge" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.x.com/community/ppx/devchallenge', 'Paypal X Developer Challenge');">Paypal X Developer Challenge</a>.
