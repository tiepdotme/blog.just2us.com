Weâ€™ve all seen sea of people holding brightly-lit phones in the air. But is this the best way to capture those special moments?

No.

We think the **phone's bright screen is a DISTRACTION** to everyone, including the person recording.

## So we build a distraction-free app

Yet, we think concertgoers should record videos of such special moments -- to keep with you FOREVER.

[Concert Camera](http://just2us.com/concertcamera/) helps you, by turning the screen off, while still recording!
