In case you are wondering if you need to pay $29.99 for every Mac that you own, you donâ€™t.

Purchase a single copy using the same iTunes account, and all your authorized Macs would be able to install. This was actually mentioned in WWDC 2011 keynote.

So, go Mac <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/os-x-lion/id444303913?mt=12" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://itunes.apple.com/app/os-x-lion/id444303913?mt=12', 'App Store and download Lion');">App Store and download Lion</a> now!
