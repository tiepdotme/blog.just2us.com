I have long suspected that iPhone could make human dumber, since there is is _an app for everything._

From the post <a href="http://lateralaction.com/articles/iphone-creativity/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://lateralaction.com/articles/iphone-creativity/', 'Is the iPhone killing your Creativity?');">Is the iPhone killing your Creativity?</a>, a researcher asked a group of schoolchildren to write whatever they liked and let their imagination runs wild. But the schoolchildren&#8217;s creativity were disappointing.

The researcher spent months to find the root of the problem, and she concluded the lack of creativity is due to lack of "empty time", or otherwise known as a time to daydream.

> The capacity to daydream enables a person to fill empty time with an enjoyable activity that can be carried on anywhere

With an iPhone, whenever you are bored, you would kill time with it.. 

No more daydreaming, no more creativity. That is the root of the problem.
