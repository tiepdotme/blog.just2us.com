SG 4D is a software that checks the weekly 4D results from Singapore Pools. It gives you a better alternative to finding out the 4D results every Wed, Sat and Sun.

Not only does it checks the recent results, SG 4D has the following additional features:

- Check the previous results (since 2005)
- Analyze 4D to find out when it last appeared as a winning number

Good luck, have fun & play smart (:
