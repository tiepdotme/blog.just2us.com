I have recently developed a <a href="http://devblog.hoiio.com/2011/08/voice-polling-who-is-the-cutest-presidential-candidate/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://devblog.hoiio.com/2011/08/voice-polling-who-is-the-cutest-presidential-candidate/', 'Voice Polling app');">Voice Polling app</a>, which polled users on <a href="http://devblog.hoiio.com/demo/voicebroadcast/results.php" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://devblog.hoiio.com/demo/voicebroadcast/results.php', 'who is the cutest presidential candidate');">who is the cutest presidential candidate</a>.

This app was at first created as a demo to a client. But to make it  fun, I chose to make use of the current presidential election to conduct a cute poll.

<a href="http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/singapore-president-election.jpg" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/singapore-president-election.jpg', '');"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-669" title="singapore-president-election" src="http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/singapore-president-election.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="267" srcset="http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/singapore-president-election-300x250.jpg 300w, http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/singapore-president-election.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a>

Do <a href="http://devblog.hoiio.com/demo/voicebroadcast/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://devblog.hoiio.com/demo/voicebroadcast/', 'try it out');">try it out</a>! You can also enter your friends&#8217; phone numbers and ask them :)

This marks my first attempt at creating a voice app &#8211; a different experience from developing mobile or web app. And surprisingly, it can be done in a short timespan (when you know the right tool).
