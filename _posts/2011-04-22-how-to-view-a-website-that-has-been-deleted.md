Sometimes, people delete their blog/website to protect their privacy.

For example, during Singapore Election, when <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nicoleseahnsp" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/nicoleseahnsp', 'Nicole Seah');">Nicole Seah</a> of NSP (National Solidarity Party) is nominated as a candidate, and she instantly becomes a public figure. 

She starts protecting her privacy on Facebook, and deleted her personal blog to avoid public scrutiny. Her blog was originally at <a href="http://crappology.blogspot.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://crappology.blogspot.com/', 'http://crappology.blogspot.com/');">http://crappology.blogspot.com/</a>

With the help of <a href="http://www.archive.org/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.archive.org/', 'Internet Archive');">Internet Archive</a>, which archive ALL public webpages periodically, you can travel back in time to look at a website. Fortunately, her blog was archived in 2007 for us to take a look.

<a href="http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20070713212452/http://crappology.blogspot.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20070713212452/http://crappology.blogspot.com/', 'http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20070713212452/http://crappology.blogspot.com/');" title="http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20070713212452/http://crappology.blogspot.com/">http://classic-web.archive.org/web/20070713212452/http://crappology.blogspot.com/</a>
