SG 4D was <a href="http://www.just2me.com/2008/10/sg-4d.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.just2me.com/2008/10/sg-4d.html', 'first released');">first released</a> in Oct 2008. Since the first day it was released, it has been in the Top 100 free apps (in Singapore App Store).

But in Jan 2010, <a href="http://live4d.sg/home.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://live4d.sg/home.html', 'SG Live 4D');">SG Live 4D</a> was released. This 4D app is developed by another company (not by me). It is the fastest and coolest (reading the numbers in Hokkien?) 4D app in the app store. And therefore, it kicked out <a href="http://just2us.com/2009/05/sg-4d/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://just2us.com/2009/05/sg-4d/', 'SG 4D');">SG 4D</a> from its throne :(

Ah.. but that is how the consumer market works. 

When there is a better product, users will eventually flock to it. Even better if it is _free_. Take the case of <a href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/01/21/nokia-announces-free-turn-by-turn-navigation-around-the-world/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/01/21/nokia-announces-free-turn-by-turn-navigation-around-the-world/', 'Google’s free vs Nokia’s paid');">Google’s free vs Nokia’s paid</a> on the mobile. Nokia is taking action _only_ because of tough competition. If there isn’t any competition, Nokia would continue to charge $$ to users. There is no reason not to earn..

Back to SG 4D. I am sure end-users will get better app when there are more choices. No doubt.
