<a href="https://pacgov.agd.gov.sg/ipac/portal/jsp/login/index1.jsp" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://pacgov.agd.gov.sg/ipac/portal/jsp/login/index1.jsp', 'PaC@Gov');">PaC@Gov</a> is a government website for 200,000 Singapore servants to view their pay slips and submit claims.

It is of course a very important website to so many Singapore servants. Yet, the website sucks.

Here is why:

  * It is **best viewed with IE6**, a web browser technology <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6', '10 years ago');">10 years ago</a>!
  * It claims to support IE6 and above, but it definitely **does not support the latest IE9**.
  
    See my screenshot below on how messed up the website is.
  * It **does NOT support Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari and Google Chrome**!
  
    That means it is <a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://gs.statcounter.com/', 'not supporting more than 50% of web users');">not supporting more than 50% of web users</a>.
  * The website is **totally unfriendly**. It took me (an experience web user) 10 attempts to submit a simple claim.

It needs big change, and big progress. It is such a shame to be a government website.

PaC@Gov, please find a better IT vendor. Please don&#8217;t use back <a href="http://www.ncs.com.sg/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ncs.com.sg/', 'NCS');">NCS</a>.

_Disclaimer: I am not working for the Government, and doesn&#8217;t need to use PaC@Gov. I wrote this post because I tried to help a teacher to submit her claim. I even attempt to <a href="http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/pac-gov-ie-css.jpg" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.just2us.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/pac-gov-ie-css.jpg', 'change its CSS');">change its CSS</a> to get back the &#8220;Make Claim&#8221; button, but failed. _I was very disappointed with the website so I felt a need to grumble here.__
