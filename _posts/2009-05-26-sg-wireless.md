The app will remember your hotspot provider, username and password. Each time you start SG Wireless, the app will immediately logs on to the connected hotspot! One click is all you need to get connected!

SG Wireless is similar to paid apps such as AutoWiFi, Easy Wi-Fi and devicescape. However, SG Wireless is FREE. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=303655424&mt=8" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=303655424&mt=8', 'Download');">Download</a> it from App Store today! You may also try <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=306063196&mt=8" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=306063196&mt=8', '1-Click Wireless@SG');">1-Click Wireless@SG</a>, also a free app that has the same purpose as SG Wireless.

#### Words from the developer

SG Wireless was developed to solve one problem with Wireless@SG &#8211; clumsy and slow login. I developed SG Wireless just to solve this problem, but it probably would not work for all hotspots!

> I can only claim that it works in Northpoint, Yishun and selected areas in NUS and NTU

As every providers (QMax, Singtel, iCell) have different login behaviours and their deployed hotspots could have different versions, it makes the work very difficult. If you encounter any problem, please send the details to <a href="http://blog.just2us.com/support/open.php" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.just2us.com/support/open.php', 'our support');">our support</a>.

Get connected, and have fun (:
